An implementation of the Monkey programming language in Rust. 

I really need to document this, but it's unlikely that I ever will (because it's unlikely anyone will run this code aside from myself). If you've somehow found your way here, you can run the repl with `cargo run repl`. You can execute a file with `cargo run FILE`.
